# NBA_shots_project

## Project Goals
This project attempts to objectively look at shot selection data from the 2020-21 and 2010-11 NBA seasons to find what the most efficient shots are. We also attempt to find any of the differences between the shot selections in the 2020-21 and 2010-11 NBA seasons. 

We attempt to visualize and explain our findings in ways that take little to no background basketball knowledge to understand.

## Running the Notebook
Our main anaylsis and report notebook is nba_data_project.ipynb. The notebook should run as is; howver, if the API does not work, we have our data for the 2020-21 and 2010-11 NBA seasons saved as .csv files in the data folder. You would simply need to use pd.read_csv() to read in the files and everything else will work just fine.

This project was a blast to work on and we hope you enjoy!
